DEDICATION
---------------------------------

This project is dedicated to all emergency service personnel who lost their lives serving their community.

Also, to my hero: my dad.

---------------------------------
ABOUT
---------------------------------

This is a mod to give lights and siren capabilities to Garry's Mod Vehicles.
It was created by Schmal in Bellingham, Washington. WEST COAST BEST COAST USA MOTHERFUCKERS.

This has been a side-project of mine since September 2013, and I've spent countless hours
watching videos and analyzing pictures of emergency vehicles and colored lights to understand and
imitate the effect. The trick lies in the hue-shift illusion caused by cameras. Similar to HDR
rendering effects, the goal is to convey the illusion of brighter-than-white by simply adjusting
the color the further out from a light source you are.


---------------------------------
CREDITS
---------------------------------

This mod would not be possible without the brilliant work of many people.

First and foremost, inspiration credit lies with the LCPD:FR community, specifically the ELS mod.
Secondly, all the sirens included in this mod were taken from the LCPD:FR website and modified for use in Garry's Mod.
Special acknowledgements to DoubleDoppler (Dave), a UK LCPD:FR modder for his great work and UK sirens.

Extra credit goes to LoneWolfie for publishing outstanding vehicles and models that this mod uses.

If you believe your work is present and you are not credited, please let me know via Twitter (@Schmal).

However, I ask that you do not republish or release the code without a link to the original mod.

I spent many months studying and developing a way to create the emitted-light effect, and this mod is my pride and joy.
You are more than welcome to copy the strategy for any sort of mod, but all I ask is you link to this and tell me
so I can see how people are using it (to make me feel good).

Please do not claim to be the original author or attempt to profit from the script itself.

You may "sell" accessability to features in this script on your server. 
For example, requiring users to make a donation or payment to access emergency light features.

The sirens in this mod are not my property. Many were taken from YouTube videos and modified, and therefore
I claim no ownership or liability for copyright claims by other authors.
